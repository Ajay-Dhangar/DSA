In Java, a string is a sequence of characters that is used to represent text. A string can be created in Java using the String class. Here's an A2Z guide on Strings in Java for beginners to advance:

## Creating a string:
Strings can be created in Java in several ways. Here are some of the most common ways:

```java
String s1 = "Hello";  // Using string literal
String s2 = new String("Hello"); // Using a constructor
char[] chars = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};
String s3 = new String(chars);  // Using a character array
```

## Concatenating strings:
Strings can be concatenated in Java using the `+` operator.

```java
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "World";
String s3 = s1 + " " + s2; // s3 will be "Hello World"
```

## Getting the length of a string:
The `length()` method can be used to get the length of a string.

```java
String s = "Hello";
int length = s.length(); // length will be 5
```

## Accessing characters in a string:
Individual characters in a string can be accessed using the `charAt()` method.

```java
String s = "Hello";
char c = s.charAt(0); // c will be 'H'
```
## Comparing strings:
Strings can be compared in Java using the `equals()` method.

```java
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "World";
boolean equal = s1.equals(s2); // equal will be false
```

### Searching for substrings:
The `indexOf()` method can be used to search for substrings in a string.

```java
String s = "Hello World";
int index = s.indexOf("World"); // index will be 6
```

## Modifying strings:
Strings in Java are immutable, which means that once a string is created, it cannot be modified. However, new strings can be created by manipulating existing strings.

```java
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = s1 + " World"; // s2 will be "Hello World"
```

## Converting strings to other types:
Strings can be converted to other types in Java using the parse methods of the wrapper classes.

```java
String s = "123";
int i = Integer.parseInt(s); // i will be 123
```

## Formatting strings:
Strings can be formatted in Java using the printf() method.

```java
String name = "Alice";
int age = 30;
System.out.printf("My name is %s and I am %d years old.", name, age);
// Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.

These are some of the most common operations that can be performed on strings in Java. 
With this knowledge, you should be able to start working with strings in your Java programs.
