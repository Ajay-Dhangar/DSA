
## Time Complexity: 
Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.
<br>
**The following 3 asymptotic notations are mostly used to represent the time complexity of algorithms:**
   - **Big-O Notation (Ο)** – worst-case scenario.
   - **Omega Notation (Ω)** – best-case scenario.
   - **Theta Notation (θ)** – average complexity of an algorithm.

## Space Complexity: <br>
Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code.
